This amount covers expenses, charges and other costs that may arise by MASS CRYP and/or its subcontractors as part of the development and execution of the MASS CRYP Project. It remains at MASS CRYP’s sole discretion to decide how to allocate the funds in order to develop and execute the MASS CRYP Project. MASS CRYP has the right to engage subcontractors to perform the entire or partial development and execution of the MASS CRYP Project.

MASS CRYP Token Platform the MASS CRYP Token Platform as well as the smart contract has been programmed according to the current state of the art. However, the Userunderstands and accepts that smart contract technology is still in an early development stage and its application is of experimental nature, which carries significant operational, technological, financial, regulatory and reputational risks. Risks the purchase of MASS carries with it significant risk. Prior to purchasing MASS, the User should carefully consider the below risks and, to the extent necessary, consult a lawyer, accountant, and/or tax professionals prior to determining whether to purchase MASS. In particular, but not concluding, the User understands the inherent risks listed hereinafter:  Risk of software weaknesses: The User understands and accepts that smart contract system concept; the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the Ethereumblockchain) is still in an early development stage and unproven. Thus there is no warranty that the process of creating and distributing MASS will be uninterrupted or error-free and there is an inherent risk that the software could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of funds and/or MASS. . Regulatory risk: The User understands and accepts that the blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction and that it is possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations on or introduce new regulations addressing blockchain technology based applications, which may be contrary to the current setup of the smart contract system and MASS CRYP Platform. This may, inter alia, result in substantial modifications of the smart contract system and/or the MASS CRYP Project, including its termination and the loss of MASS for the User.Risk of abandonment / lack of success: The User understands and accepts that the creation of the MASS and the development of the MASS CRYP Project may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects (e.g. caused by competing projects). The User therefore understands that there is no assurance that, even if the MASS CRYP Project is partially or fully developed and launched, the User will receive any benefits through the MASS held by him/her. . Risk associated with other applications: The User understands and accepts that the MASS CRYP Project may give rise to other alternative projects, promoted by unaffiliated third parties, under which MASS will have no intrinsic value. Risk of Losing Access to Tokens Due to Loss of Private Key(s), Custodial Error or your Error: A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of Tokens stored in your digital wallet or vault. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with you digital wallet or vault storing Tokens will result in loss of such Tokens. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet service you use, may be able to misappropriate your Tokens. Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the digital wallet or vault you choose to receive and store Tokens, including your own failure to properly maintain or use such digital wallet or vault, may also result in the loss of your Tokens. Additionally, your failure to precisely follow the procedures set forth in for buying and receiving tokens, including, for instance, if you provide an incorrect Token Receipt Address. The User understands and accepts that, as with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the smart contract system is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the smart contract system, expected proper execution and sequencing of MASS transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations. Risk of incompatible Wallet service: The User understands and accepts, that the wallet or wallet service provider used for purchasing MASS, has to be technically compatible with the MASS. Failure to assure this may have the result that User will not gain access to his/her MASS. Risks related to Amendments: Amendments to the MASS CRYP Platform’s protocols and software, if accepted and authorized by the MASS CRYP Platform’s community, could adversely affect MASS. The MASS CRYP Platform governs the peer-to-peer interactions between computers connected to the MASS CRYP platform. To the extent that a significant majority of the Users on the MASS CRYP Platform install software upgrade(s), the MASS CRYP Platform would be subject to new protocols and software that may adversely affect MASS. If more than a significant majority of the Users on the MASS CRYP platform install such software upgrade(s), the MASS CRYPPlatform could “fork.” A failure to properly monitor and upgrade the protocol could damage the MASS CRYP Platform and MASS. Risks related to intellectual property rights claims: Intellectual property rights claims may adversely affect the operation of the MASS CRYP Platform. Third parties may assert intellectual property claims relating to the holding and transfer of digital assets and their source code. Regardless of the merit of any intellectual property or other legal action, any threatened action that reduces confidence in the MASS CRYP Platform’s long-term viability or the ability of end-Users to hold and transfer MASS may adversely affect the value of MASS. Additionally, a meritorious intellectual property claim could prevent MASS CRYP and/or other end-Users from accessing the MASS CRYP Platform or holding or transferring their MASS. . No Liability. The User bears the sole responsibility to determine if the purchase, ownership or use of MASS, the potential appreciation or depreciation in the value of MASS over time (if any), the allocation of MASS and/or any other action or transaction related to the MASS CRYP Project have tax implications for him/her.
